# Intro
Optional static typing provides various benefits for dynamic programming languages (DPLs) such as early bug detection, better program analysis, improved IDE support, and so on. In recent years, researchers have been proposed machine learning-based type inference approaches for DPLs. However, the type inference task is still quite challenging, especially for user-defined and rare types. Motivated by this, we have created a competition for ML-based type inference for Python.
